HostsGrabber features a GUI and grabs ad-server lists from multiple sources and compiles the lists into one,
removing duplicate entries while maintaining the original authors' comments. Altering one's hosts file is a nice
alternative to using ad-blocking extensions as ad-blocking extensions can use a lot of additional system resources
while the hosts file method uses minimal resources. The program only applies the file automatically to the system
in OS X and Unix systems only at the moment, and requires a sudo password in order to update the system's hosts file.
